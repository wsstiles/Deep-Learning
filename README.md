# Deep-Learning
A Deep Learning project space in which I explore various methods of constructing neural networks, including Artificial Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Street_View_ANN.ipynb
In this project, I create and train an **Artificial Neural Network** model to recognize Google Street View address numbers.

## Street_View_CNN.ipynb
In this project, I create and train a **Convolutional Neural Network** model to recognize Google Street View address numbers.

#### Google Street View Dataset (Available for download for access with Google Colab/Jupyter)

## Fashion_MNIST_ANN.ipynb
In this project, I explore some methods to approach classification problems with an **Artificial Neural Network** model. This ANN is used to classify articles of clothing using the Fashion MNIST dataset from TensorFlow.
